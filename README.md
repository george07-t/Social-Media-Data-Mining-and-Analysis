A comprehensive project focused on extracting and analyzing user comments from Facebook and YouTube to derive actionable insights. This project uncovers sentiment patterns, user engagement trends, and public opinion, categorizing data into thematic groups for advanced analysis and preparation for NLP-based sentiment classification.

---

## **Project Overview**

This project leverages web scraping and data preprocessing techniques to collect and analyze user-generated comments from two popular social media platforms: **Facebook** and **YouTube**. The goal is to understand user sentiments, identify engagement trends, and organize data for further analysis.

Key features include:
- Extraction of comments, metadata (likes, timestamps), and user profiles.
- Categorization of data into themes for targeted analysis.
- Preparation of datasets for sentiment analysis and natural language processing (NLP).

---

## **Key Features**

- **Web Scraping**: Automated data extraction from Facebook and YouTube using tools like `apify-client` and `youtube-comment-downloader`.
- **Data Structuring**: Organizes scraped data into structured formats using `Pandas`.
- **Sentiment Analysis Preparation**: Datasets are preprocessed and ready for advanced NLP-based sentiment analysis.
- **Categorization**: Groups data into predefined themes to explore trends and user behavior.

---

## **Technologies and Tools**

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Web Scraping**: Apify Client, YouTube Comment Downloader
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Export**: OpenPyXL, CSV
- **Visualization** (future implementation): Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **NLP Preparation**: Ready for integration with libraries like `NLTK`, `spaCy`, and `Transformers`.

- The outputs are shown in the image after the data and sentiment have been analyzed.
- These CSV files can be used for visualization or as inputs for NLP models for further analysis.
  
   
## **Future Enhancements**

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Implement NLP models like BERT to classify sentiments in comments.
- **Trend Visualization**: Add graphical representations of sentiment trends over time.
- **Dashboard**: Build an interactive dashboard for exploring insights.
